# README for TypeForm based Flask Application for Quizzes and Questionnaires

First make a Flask based package. Usually done using __init__.py in a sub-folder of the package (folder). The package (folder) also consists of a file 'package_name.py'.

Check the flask implementation locally. Then initialize the folder using git init, add, and commit the files. Then make a url in heroku, using the command, `heroku create`. Finally, push the committed files to the heroku url just created above using git push command.
